# Introduction
I recently got my R36S.
To customize it further i have created some boot and loading screens.

***I organized this repository by `Boot-` and `Loading-Screens`.
Both folders have subfolders, each with the name of the image - to get a better overview.***

[![treeview](https://github.com/TueftelTyp/R3xS_Custom_Screens/blob/main/treeview.png?raw=true "treeview")](https://github.com/TueftelTyp/R3xS_Custom_Screens/blob/main/treeview.png?raw=true "treeview")

## Installation
Copy / move the files to the system SD card.

***The existing files should be backed up beforehand, as they may be overwritten!***

1. `logo.bmp` (startup image) [*in `\Boot-Screens` subfolders*]
	to the root of the `BOOT` partition. 
	- If there is a folder `BMPs` in the `BOOT` partition, take the desired image from the folder `BMPs` or the entire folder of the repostitory and paste it into the folder of the same name in the `BOOT` partition.
	
2. `loading.jpg` (loading image before the game starts) [*in `\Loading Screens` subfolders*]
	to `EASYROMS:\launchimages` in the `EASYROMS` partition.

## I will probably update this repostitory from time to time, so have fun browsing and then playing.
- update 4|22|2024: i have just added the original screens: `\defaultScreens`
